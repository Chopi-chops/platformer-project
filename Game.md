<h1 align=center> COM-119 2025S Project 1: platformer-project </h1>
<h5 align=center>This project aims to strengthen understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation and data abstraction. It also introduces practical applications of exception handling for robust error management dealing with file input and output. It can also serve as testing grounds for concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.</h5>

To get started, clone the repository to get the starter code. You are encouraged to modify and refactor it as needed to meet the project requirements.

Be inventive in applying OOP principles to redesign the game, ensuring to implement the following critical modifications:

As part of improving the structure and maintainability of the game codebase, I undertook a comprehensive refactoring process to adopt an object-oriented design approach.

Refactoring the code to an object-oriented design presented several challenges. Initially, the existing code was tightly coupled, with global variables and functions scattered throughout. It took careful analysis to identify logical groupings of functionalities that could be encapsulated within classes.

The biggest challenge was ensuring that the transition to classes did not break existing game functionality. I approached this incrementallyâ€”first isolating functions, then transforming them into methods within classes, and finally managing dependencies between objects through clear interfaces.
